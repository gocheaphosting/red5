We will sort out a bug tracker soon, but for now we are just using a text file :)

1. If you switch between videos quickly it gets messed and video appears distorted.
2. Only one video at any one time per connection. 
3. On metadata sometimes does not come through, esp when first video is played.
4. After the client has been idle for a long(ish) period, when you go to play again it sends an odd packet to the server, we dont know what this packet is yet.
5. After running the server for a long time and viewing lots of videos with the client the server seemed to stop sending video data and in the logs it shows end of stream just after play.
6. We may have some problems with write buffer sizes and also bandwidth control

We should have all these bugs fixed before moving on to other features. Hopefully this wont take more than a few days.

If you find a bug that is not listed above and is not releated to an unfinished feature please send it to the mailing list.
